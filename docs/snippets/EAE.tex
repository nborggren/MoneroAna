\section{EAE Experiments}

Although this section is very incomplete I'll describe the experiments that are underway.  
For the sake of this effort 15 transactions were made.  
\begin{itemize}
\item 5 churning transactions from myself (monero-cli) to myself.
\item 5 transactions from myself to a popular self-custodial wallet.
\item 5 transactions from myself to an exchange.  
\end{itemize}

These repeated transactions form the basis for our investigations of the 2-AE through 5-AE attack.  
The codes and results are still being verified, and I'll find a way to present the information in a redacted way for the sake of privacy.
The preliminary results are that historical transactions can be found but spurious connections are also present.

We will be establishing experiments to find intersections of uncorrelated transactions to provide a background, ideally any false pair of transactions will also have intersections with similar statistics.
