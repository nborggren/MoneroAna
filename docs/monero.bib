abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2020, arXiv, All rights reserved. Monero is a popular crypto-currency which focuses on privacy. The blockchain uses cryptographic techniques to obscure transaction values as well as a â€˜ring confidential transaction' which seeks to hide a real transaction among a variable number of spoofed transactions. We have developed training sets of simulated blockchains of 10 and 50 agents, for which we have control over the ground truth and keys, in order to test these claims. We featurize Monero transactions by characterizing the local structure of the public-facing blockchains and use labels obtained from the simulations to perform machine learning. Machine Learning of our features on the simulated blockchain shows that the technique can be used to aide in identifying individuals and groups, although it did not successfully reveal the hidden transaction values. We apply the technique on the real Monero blockchain to identify ShapeShift transactions, a cryptocurrency exchange that has leaked information through their API providing labels for themselves and their users.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2020, arXiv, All rights reserved. A variety of correlations are detected in the Monero blockchain. The joint distribution of the time- since-last-transaction between elements of pairs of RingCTs is enhanced in comparison with the product of the marginal distributions. Similarly there is an enhancement in the joint distribution of the hour timestamps between the same pairs. Lastly, we find another enhancement when the correlation is measured between the hour timestamps of the transaction itself and the elements of the RingCTs. We calculate some adjustments to the probabilities of which input in a RingCT is real, providing an additional heuristic to denoising the Monero blockchain.},
